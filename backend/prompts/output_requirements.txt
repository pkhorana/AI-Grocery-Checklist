- Generate a clear, categorized grocery list, with concise ingredient names and quantities.
- For each ingredient, specify the recommended quantity in common grocery store units 
    (e.g., "1 bag of flour", "1 carton of milk", "1 dozen eggs", "1 pound ground beef", "1 standard jar of cinnamon").
- Prioritize standard package sizes that reasonably cover the recipe's needs, aiming for practicality over exact measurement.
- If a recipe calls for a small amount of an ingredient (e.g., 1/4 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda), suggest buying a 
    standard small package of that item, as it's a pantry staple.
- If an ingredient is fresh produce, convert quantities (e.g., "1 medium onion" for 1 cup chopped, "1 bunch of parsley" for a few sprigs).
- For meats, suggest common package weights (e.g., 1.5 lbs chicken breast -> 1 package chicken breasts, approx. 1.5-2 lbs).
- Do not include items that are not typically bought in grocery stores (e.g., 
    "water" unless specified in the recipe).
- Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
