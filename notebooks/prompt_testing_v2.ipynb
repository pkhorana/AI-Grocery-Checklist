      " Prompt: Explain TypeScript in simple terms.\n",
      "Response: TypeScript is a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding some extra features. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Superset of JavaScript**: TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with additional tools. Anything you can do in JavaScript, you can also do in TypeScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Static Typing**: One of the main features of TypeScript is static typing. This means you can specify the types of variables (like numbers, strings, or objects) when you write your code. This helps catch errors early, making your code more reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Better Tooling**: Because of its static types, TypeScript provides better development tools, like autocompletion, easier navigation, and more helpful error messages in your code editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transpilation to JavaScript**: TypeScript code needs to be converted (or \"transpiled\") into regular JavaScript so that it can run in web browsers or on servers. This process ensures that you can still use all JavaScript features while taking advantage of TypeScript's benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Widely Used**: Many developers and large projects use TypeScript because it helps in writing cleaner, more manageable code, especially in complex applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, TypeScript is like a more structured version of JavaScript that helps developers write better code by adding types and improving error checking.\n",
