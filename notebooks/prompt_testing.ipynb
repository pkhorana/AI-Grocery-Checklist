      "\n",
      "**TypeScript is a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding \"types\".**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **JavaScript** is a popular language used for building websites and apps.\n",
      "- **Types** help you tell the computer what kind of data you’re working with (for example, a number, a word, or a list).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why use TypeScript?**\n",
      "- It helps catch mistakes before your code runs. For example, it warns you if you try to use a number as if it were a word.\n",
      "- It makes it easier for you and others to understand your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**  \n",
      "TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with extra tools that help you write safer and clearer code.\n",
